## Fetching Data from http://corisca.hockey

In October of 2017, I decided to try my hand at Daily Fantasy Hockey. I've spent nearly all of the 2017-2018 NHL season playing on [DraftKings](affiliate_link). While my best win was taking home 2nd place in a field of over 6k, for a 233% profit, I have endured quite the roller coaster. Like any new hobby, I tend to become all encompassed by it.

Having over 20 years of NFL season long fantasy experience and a couple years of NFL daily fantasy experience, I knew that sourcing good and reliable data about the sport was paramount. I dug in to various free sources and paid for a couple of the major outlets for information.

The guys over at [Morning Skate Podcast]() have been crucial in my success and the GroupMe that they manage has opened up my eyes to all sorts of data points and ways of using that data to increase my chances of success. If you gain nothing more from this blog post than the awareness of their podcat, it will have been worth writing it.
